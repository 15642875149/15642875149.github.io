<b>What is Better Terminal Emulator Pro?</b><br>
<i>Better Terminal Emulator Pro (BTEP)</i> is a Terminal Emulator for your Android powered device. <i>BTEP</i> provides several terminal-oriented functions, including an SSH client, Telnet client, FTP client, and access to the local Android shell on your phone.<br><br>

<b>How do I start <i>BTEP</i>?</b><br>
BTEP has two modes of operation.  In the default mode, BTEP will start up running the BASH shell on your local Android device.  If you prefer, you can configure <i>BTEP</i> to start up in GUI mode, which allows you to easily start local, SSH, telnet, or FTP sessions.  In addition, you can create shortcuts to the home screen using the GUI or by long pressing the home screen on your phone and selecting <i>BTEP SSH Client</i>.<br> <br>


<b>What are the Enhanced Utilities for <i>BTEP</i>?</b><br>
In order for features like the BASH shell, SSH, telnet, and FTP to work within <i>BTEP</i> these utilities must be installed on your Android device.  <i>BTEP</i> will download the appropriate utilities for your Android device's processor, and install them for you in <i>BTEP</i>'s application directory.  Your phone does not need to be rooted in order to install the Enhanced Utilities, and if you uninstall <i>BTEP</i> these utilities will be uninstalled as well.<br> <br>

<b>Help, I enabled full-screen mode, and can't bring up the menu!</b><br>
<i>BTEP</i> has additional options available when you long-press the display.  In this menu, there is a "Menu" button, the ability to select an alternate Input Method, turn on/off Text-to-Speech, access special characters and more.<br>
<br>
<b>What if I have problems with <i>BTEP</i>?</b><br>
<i>BTEP</i> is a powerful but complex program that pushes the boundaries of what is possible for Android applications.  While <i>BTEP</i> does not modify the Android operating system in any way, it does interact closely with it.  While I have tested <i>BTEP</i> on many Android phones and tablets, across different operating system versions and custom ROMs, it is possible that you could experience issues on your particular device.  If you do find issue, please contact me by email, and I will work with you to resolve the issue.  Submitting problem reports through the Comments section of Android Market is not helpful in debugging the issue, due to limited space.<br>
